# CTEC3905 Assignment - Mercedes Car Website

This is my assignment repository for CTEC3905 Front-end web development.

## Acknowledgements

The site was created as a car website for Mercedes. JavaScript was used in the following ways:
1. For the Mobile navigation using code adopted from the labs.
2. For the History page making use of a collapsible layout.
3. For form manipulation on the Contact page.
4. For integrating an API, namely News API, which can be found on the index page to show recent news about Mercedes by manipulating the JSON data. The lab materials were adapted for use with this API.

CSS flexbox was used for the navigation and CSS grids were used for the articles on the homepage and the gallery images.

CSS transitions were used for the desktop format only in the following ways:
1. To change the colour of the navigation on hover of an element.
2. To rotate the logo on hover.
3. to rotate the images on the gallery page on hover.

## Validation & bugs
All code has been validated and there are no errors to be reported.
There is a warning for using the date input type but this was ignored since it was also used in the labs and works. Also, initially there was a type error with the JavaScript for the collapsible feature which was later resolved through debugging using console.log and then using a different method. It now works.
