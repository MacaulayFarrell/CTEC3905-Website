The company has set itself the goal of developing the world’s safest and most efficient cars.

    <button class="btnAbout">Ambition 2039: the road to sustainable mobility.</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>Under the heading “Ambition 2039”, Mercedes-Benz Cars has set itself ambitious yet realistic goals. As part of this, the automotive manufacturer is examining the issue of sustainability along the entire value chain. The goal is the transformation of the full range of passenger cars into a carbon-neutral product range as of 2039. This includes topics such as raw materials and the supply chain, the production of the vehicles, their use phase and recycling concepts. Similar transformation plans are being developed for the commercial vehicles. Already during the development of a new model, Mercedes-Benz Cars looks at its environmental performance over the entire life cycle. Vehicles from Mercedes-Benz Cars are scrutinised in a comprehensive life-cycle assessment, the so-called 360-degree environmental check: from manufacture of the raw materials to production and from vehicle operation to recycling at the end of the vehicle’s service life – a long way off in the case of a new Mercedes-Benz.</p>

    <button class="btnAbout">The Purpose of Mercedes-Benz Cars.</button>
    <div class="details">
      <p>“First Move the World” - that is the Purpose of Mercedes-Benz Cars. It is the deeper meaning behind our work, it is what drives us, our “reason why”. “First Move the World” means pursuing more than what is immediately achievable. This pioneering spirit is part of our DNA. In times of change, it gives us a direction for our all-embracing and sustainable business strategy, and for our decisions. It gave rise to, for example, Ambition 2039 – our road to sustainable mobility, green production with CO2-neutral energy supply and the long term development cooperation for automated driving with Daimler AG and the BMW Group.</p>
